Created initial directories with source files
Source/
    Scripts_1/
        Source_1_1
        Source_1_2
    Scripts_2/
        Source_2_1


Made local git repo
Test Repo$ git init


checked status, noted that all files are untracked
Test Repo git status


added the Source/ dir to the staging environment
Test Repo$ git add Source/


checked status, noted that source files are in staging, but not yet committed
git status


committed files in staging
git commit -m "first commit with initial source files"
got failure message because i have not provided any identity information

Added identify information
git config --global user.name "Cal Gosla III"
git config --global user.email cbgosla@gmail.com

Can check user info with    git config user.name


attempted commit, succesful
git commit -m "first commit with initial source files"


Make modification to source_1_1 file ("modification 1")

add to staging and commit
git add
git commit -m "...."

git log shows two commits.

git checkout xxxx to look at first commit
worked successfully

git checkout master to get back to latest commit

will make branch
git checkout -b branch_1
git branch shows i'm in the right branch

modified source 2_1 file in this branch, committed
added "modification 2"

Note, there is no commit for the creation of the branch.

modified source 2_1 file in branch 1, committed
added "modificaiton 3"
all looks good

merging branch_1 into master
git checkout master
git merge branch_1

made new branch 2 from master
modified source 2,1 with modificaiton 4
committed

switch to master, modify source 1,2 with "modification 5. add, commit.
now master and branch 2 are different
will merge

now will make branch, 3, do modificaiton 6 in source 2.1, add, commit
will switch to makster, do modification 7 in source 2.1, add, committ

noted a merge conflict, corrected the conflict manually in the file
several backup files were left behind, had to delete manually.
configured git to use meld as merge tool

need to try merge conflict using meld through git.

success.

pushed to github using
git remote add origin https://github.com/calzone41/Test_Repo.git
git push -u origin master

made a new branch, going to attempt to push only branch to remote. made source 3.1
git checkout -b branch_5
git add Source/
git commit -m "brnach 5, mod 11, source 3.1"
git push -u origin branch_5

on github, it prompted for a pull request, it did it, and it seemed to merge the branch into master, which is not what i wanted, i just wanted it to put the branch onto github.
going to pull in changes from remote and try again.

git pull origin master

Success

modifing branch 5 again

git push -u origin branch_5
github shows change, but did not merge to master

create branch 6
do commit in branch 6
git push -u origin branch_6

branch 6 shows up in github

modify branch 5 and 6 locally

noticing that when checking out 5 and 6, git sees that my branch is ahead of origin/branch* by x commits. awesome.

git push --all -u

now all branches show up on github.

YAY!
